India's retail inflation rate eased to a 12-month low in May, driven by a decline in food and fuel prices, according to data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 4.2% compared to the same month last year, marking a steady decline from Aprilâ€™s 4.8% reading.

Economists attribute the dip to a favorable monsoon forecast and improved supply chain efficiency in essential commodities. The price of edible oils, pulses, and vegetables showed the sharpest reduction, while fuel prices also softened due to global oil trends.

Policy analysts suggest that the easing inflationary pressure could give the Reserve Bank of India more flexibility in future monetary decisions. While the central bank held interest rates steady this month, some experts believe a rate cut could be on the table if the trend continues.

The government has reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining price stability while supporting economic growth through targeted subsidies and reforms in the logistics sector.
