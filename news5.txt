Marine researchers have announced the discovery of a previously unknown glowing jellyfish species found deep in the Pacific Ocean. This breakthrough was achieved by the Oceanic Research Initiative using next-generation underwater drones capable of capturing high-definition footage.

The new jellyfish emits blue and green bioluminescence and has a distinct flickering pattern, which scientists believe may serve purposes like signaling or defense. This behavior is rare among similar species and has sparked interest in the biological mechanisms behind it.

Scientists say the find sheds light on the rich biodiversity hidden in the oceanâ€™s depths and highlights the need for greater conservation of deep-sea ecosystems. Upcoming studies will investigate its genetics, habitat function, and potential medical applications.

This significant find emphasizes how little is known about marine life and how technological advancements are enabling deeper exploration of the underwater world.
